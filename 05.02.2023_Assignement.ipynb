    "Encapsulation: This is the mechanism of wrapping up data and behavior (methods) into a single unit, which is called a class. The data is hidden from the outside world and can be accessed only through public methods. Encapsulation provides data security, abstraction, and better maintainability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: This is the mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class. It allows the creation of a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. Inheritance provides reusability of code, reduces code duplication, and helps in creating hierarchies of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: This is the ability of objects to take on many forms. It means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility of code, improves code readability and reduces complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: This is the process of hiding the complexity of a system and presenting only the necessary details to the user. Abstraction is achieved by defining interfaces that specify the behavior of objects without exposing their implementation. Abstraction helps in designing modular and scalable systems, enhances code maintainability, and reduces dependencies between components."
