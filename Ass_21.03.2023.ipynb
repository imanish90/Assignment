    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used in machine learning to encode categorical variables as numerical values. However, they differ in how they assign numerical values to the categories.\n",

    "Ordinal encoding involves assigning a numerical value to each category based on their order or rank. For example, if we have a variable \"size\" with categories \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", we can assign the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively, based on their order. This type of encoding is useful when there is an inherent order or hierarchy to the categories.\n",

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two variables are linearly related. It measures how much two variables change together.

A negative covariance indicates a negative relationship, meaning that when one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.\n",

For example, covariance is commonly used in finance to measure the relationship between the returns of different stocks or investments.
