    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows easy retrieval, storage, and management of data. A database can be viewed as a digital filing cabinet where information is stored, categorized, and easily accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL. SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. NoSQL, on the other hand, stands for \"not only SQL\" and is a type of database that is not based on the traditional SQL database model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases are based on the relational model, which means that data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and relationships are established between tables. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, can have different data structures, including key-value pairs, document-based, column-based, or graph-based structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that if you need to handle more data or more users, you need to upgrade your hardware to a more powerful server. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable, which means that you can add more servers to your database cluster to handle more data or more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: SQL databases have a predefined schema that must be followed, which means that changing the structure of the database can be difficult. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are more flexible and can easily adapt to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL to query and manipulate data, while NoSQL databases use their own query languages, which are specific to each database type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are a good fit for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and a fixed data structure, while NoSQL databases are more suitable for applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and fast performance with unstructured or semi-structured data."

A primary key can be made up of one or more columns and is typically used as a reference by other tables to establish relationships.

For example, in a table of orders, there may be a foreign key column that references the primary key of the customers table. This ensures that each order is associated with a valid customer.\n",
