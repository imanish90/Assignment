    "Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs. Flask is built on top of the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and can be used with different web servers such as Apache or Nginx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some advantages of using Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework and requires minimal configuration. This makes it easy to use and deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible: Flask is designed to be flexible and can be customized to meet specific needs. It doesn't impose a strict structure on the application, allowing developers to create applications in their preferred way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to learn for developers who are new to web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large community: Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support through online forums and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with other tools: Flask can be easily integrated with other tools and libraries, such as SQLAlchemy for database integration and WTForms for form validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask provides a modular architecture, which means that developers can easily add new features and functionalities to their application by adding extensions and plugins.\n",
