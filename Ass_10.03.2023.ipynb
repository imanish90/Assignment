    "Estimation statistics refers to a set of techniques used to estimate population parameters, such as mean, variance, or proportion, based on sample data. There are two main types of estimation in statistics: point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the value of an unknown population parameter. Point estimates are usually computed from sample statistics, such as the sample mean, sample proportion, or sample variance. For example, if we want to estimate the average height of adult men in a city, we might randomly sample 100 men and compute the sample mean height. This sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimate, on the other hand, is a range of values that is used to estimate the value of an unknown population parameter. The interval estimate is constructed by calculating a confidence interval, which is a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the average height of adult men in a city might be constructed by calculating the mean height of a sample of 100 men and then constructing an interval around this sample mean that has a 95% probability of containing the population mean height. The resulting interval estimate provides more information about the possible range of values of the population parameter than a point estimate.\n",

Point estimate provides a single value estimate of the parameter, while interval estimate provides a range of values that is likely to contain the parameter with a certain level of confidence."

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used to evaluate the plausibility of a hypothesis about a population parameter, based on sample data.

It also allows researchers to compare different groups or variables, and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or treatments.\n",
