    "Mean: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. It represents the average value of the data. The mean can be affected by outliers, which can skew the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. It is not affected by outliers and is often used when there are extreme values in the data.\n",

    "Mode: The mode is the most frequent value in a dataset. It can be used for nominal and ordinal data.\n",

    "Measures of variability:\n",

    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It is a simple measure of the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance measures how far each value in a dataset is from the mean. It is calculated by summing the squared differences between each value and the mean, and then dividing by the number of values minus one. A higher variance indicates a wider spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a commonly used measure of variability and provides a standardized measure of the spread of the data. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures can be used to describe a dataset in various ways. For example, the mean can provide an overall average of the data, while the median can give a measure of the middle value of the data that is not affected by outliers. The range can give a quick estimate of the spread of the data, while the variance and standard deviation provide a more precise measure of the variability of the data. Understanding these measures of central tendency and variability can help researchers and analysts to better understand and communicate the characteristics of their data."
