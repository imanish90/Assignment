    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting in several ways:\n",

    "Feature Randomness: When building each decision tree, the algorithm randomly selects a subset of the features from the training data. This randomness helps to reduce the correlation between the trees and prevents them from overfitting to specific features.\n",

    "Data Randomness: In addition to feature randomness, the algorithm also randomly selects a subset of the training data to build each decision tree. This helps to reduce the effect of outliers and noise in the data and ensures that the trees are not overly sensitive to any particular data points.\n",

By averaging the outputs of multiple trees, the algorithm reduces the impact of individual trees that may have overfit the data.\n",
