    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. In other words, R-squared measures the goodness of fit of a linear regression model, indicating how well the model fits the observed data.\n",
