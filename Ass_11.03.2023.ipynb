    "To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test, we need to follow these steps:\n",

    "α = 0.1\n",

    "Step 3: Calculate the test statistic\n",

    "\n",
    "t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n))\n",

    "Step 4: Determine the critical values and p-value\n",
    "Since we have a two-tailed test with a level of significance of 0.1 and 29 degrees of freedom (n - 1), we can find the critical values from a t-distribution table or calculator. The critical values are approximately -1.699 and 1.699.\n",

    "To find the p-value, we can use a t-distribution table or calculator. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Since we have a two-tailed test, we need to find the area in both tails beyond the critical values. The p-value turns out to be approximately 0.100.\n",

    "Since the calculated t-test statistic (0) is between the critical values (-1.699 and 1.699), and the p-value (0.100) is greater than the level of significance (0.1), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence to conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level.\n",
