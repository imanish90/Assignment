    "Ensemble techniques in machine learning are methods that combine multiple models to produce more accurate and robust predictions than any single model could achieve alone. The idea behind ensemble techniques is that by aggregating the predictions of several models, we can reduce the risk of overfitting and increase the generalization performance of the overall model.\n",

    "Bagging: In this technique, multiple models are trained independently on different subsets of the training data and their predictions are averaged or combined in some way to produce the final output.\n",

    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) is an ensemble technique in machine learning where multiple models are trained on different subsets of the training data, and their predictions are combined to produce the final output.\n",

    "In bagging, each model is trained on a random subset of the original training data, sampled with replacement (i.e., some data points may appear multiple times in a given subset). The subsets are typically of equal size, but may also be different in size. Since each subset is sampled randomly, each model will have a slightly different set of training data, and will therefore make slightly different predictions.\n",
