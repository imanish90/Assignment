    "Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for regression tasks. It is a type of boosting algorithm that iteratively combines a set of weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a single, strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind GBR is to fit a series of decision trees to the residuals (i.e., the differences between the predicted values and the true values) of the previous trees. In other words, GBR starts by fitting a simple decision tree to the training data, and then fits additional trees to the residuals of the previous trees in order to improve the model's predictions. Each subsequent tree is fit to the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the current predictions, hence the name \"gradient boosting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training process, GBR uses a loss function (e.g., mean squared error or mean absolute error) to measure the difference between the predicted and true values. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the current predictions, and fits a new tree to the negative gradient values. The resulting predictions of all the trees are then combined to produce the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of GBR is that it is able to handle a wide variety of data types and is generally robust to noisy or missing data. It is also able to capture nonlinear relationships between the features and the target variable, and can be used for both regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, GBR can be sensitive to overfitting if the number of trees is too large or if the hyperparameters are not tuned properly. Additionally, the training process can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, particularly for large datasets or complex models."
