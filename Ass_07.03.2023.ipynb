    "The mean (average) score for this dataset is 94.5, which may seem like a reasonable estimate of the typical exam score. However, if we add an outlier to this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 200\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean score jumps to 118.5, which is much higher than the typical exam score. This is because the outlier score of 200 is so much larger than the other scores in the dataset that it pulls the mean towards the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, outliers can also affect measures of dispersion, such as the range, standard deviation, and interquartile range. In the above example, the range of the dataset increases from 20 to 120 when the outlier is added, indicating a much wider spread of scores. The standard deviation and interquartile range are also likely to be affected by the presence of an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is important to carefully examine the presence of outliers in a dataset and their potential impact on statistical measures of central tendency and dispersion. Outliers may be valid data points that reflect the true variability of the population, or they may be errors or anomalies that should be excluded or treated separately in the analysis."
